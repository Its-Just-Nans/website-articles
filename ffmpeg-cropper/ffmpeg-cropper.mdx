<Thought>
Ever add a ffmpeg video that you wanted to crop?

But it's a pain to do have the right crop filter ðŸ˜Ÿ?
</Thought>


Introducing [ffmpeg-cropper](https://n4n5.dev/ffmpeg-cropper/). Drag and drop your video and select the crop area. The tool will generate the ffmpeg filter for you (you can even play the video to check if the crop is correct).

Most important part of the code are

- the drop zone

    ```html
    <div
        ondrop="dropHandler(event);"
        ondragover="dragOverHandler(event, true);"
        ondragleave="dragOverHandler(event, false);"
    >
    ```
    > The `ondragover` and `ondragleave` should call `event.preventDefault();` to allow the drop

- the (video) file to `src` conversion

    ```js
    const fileURL = window.URL.createObjectURL(file);
    video = document.createElement("video");
    video.src = fileURL;
    ```

    > Note that [`createObjectURL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL_static) can use a lot of memory, so don't forget to revoke the URL when you don't need it anymore with [`window.URL.revokeObjectURL(fileURL);`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/revokeObjectURL_static)
