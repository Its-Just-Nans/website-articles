Inside your google maps takeout, you will find:

- a file named `Records.json` containing all the data points of your location history
- a folder `Semantic Location History` containing the analysis of the data

The `Semantic Location History` contains each year with one file per month, each containing:

- a place
- a point (to create a simplified journey)

Very interesting to see `wifiScan` in `Timeline Edits.json`...
