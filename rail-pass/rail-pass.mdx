`Pass Rail` by SNCF cost 50€ for unlimited `TER` and `Intercités` travel for 1 month. And reduced price for `Intercités de nuit - couchette` trains

```
Le Pass Rail est un dispositif financé par l'État et les Régions pour permettre aux jeunes entre 16 et 27 ans de toutes nationalités de découvrir la France en train durant l'été 2024 (1er juillet au 31 août).

Problems with the pass:

```
Free cancellation until the day before departure on regional trains without reservation
```

1. **Limited spontaneity:**

The Pass Rail is designed to help travelers discover France, which should include a sense of adventure and spontaneity. However, spontaneity is restricted since you must book trains in advance. If you decide to change plans, you must cancel your reservation the day before. This restriction limits the freedom of adventure.

> Concretely, if you plan a trip between two cities and, during your journey, you think, _"Oh, maybe I can visit another city instead"_ you can't because <span style="color:red">you can't cancel your ticket on the same day!</span>

2. **Issues with train delays:**

Another problem arises when trains are delayed. If you need to take multiple trains and the first one is late, you're stuck. You can't take another (delayed) ticket for the second train because **you can't hold two tickets for the same time slot**, and <span style="color:red">you can't cancel the first one</span>.

> You might think, _"Just book the ticket right before departure!"_ and that could work, except if the train is full, then you're in trouble.

3. **App limitations:**

The trip-planning app only allows up to two train changes and doesn't work well with `TER`. If you find a better route on your own, you can't adjust your itinerary because <span style="color:red">you can't cancel your ticket</span>.

> Example, to do Paris Marseille by TER, the app will suggest more or less to do

<div class="trip">
    <span class="bold">Paris</span> -(5h)-> <span class="bold">Lyon</span> -(3h30)-> <span class="bold">Marseille</span>
</div>

> However, you could take this route:

<div class="trip">
<span class="bold">Paris</span> -(5h)-> <span class="bold">Lyon</span> -(1h)-> <span class="bold">Valence</span> -(1h)-> <span class="bold">Avignon</span> -(1h)-> <span class="bold">Marseille</span>
</div>

> Or, if you enjoy train travel, you could try:

<div class="trip">
<span class="bold">Paris</span> -(3h)-> <span class="bold">Vichy</span> -(2h)-> <span class="bold">Lyon</span> -(1h)-> <span class="bold">Valence</span> -(1h)-> <span class="bold">Avignon</span> -(1h)-> <span class="bold">Marseille</span>
</div>

> You might say,  _"But all trips take about the same amount of time!"_ Yes, but **no**, because of the waiting times between trains. For the simple Paris → Lyon → Marseille route, you might have to wait 3-5 hours in Lyon!

> With the second option, you take more trains but have almost no waiting time.

Conclusion

**Suggestion for SNCF:** Please allow same-day ticket cancellations!

(There's no reason to restrict this since tickets are free with the pass.)

Another question:

Why is the pass limited to the summer only?
