## 2023-09-16 - The end

As all good things come to an end, the Bel-art club is parting ways with Rezel and will remain in a limbo state like Schr√∂dinger's cat: neither dead nor alive.

Using Article `58 bis` of the Internal Regulations of Bel-art in Rezel, I hereby resign (`CA_Rezel_2023-09-16`).
