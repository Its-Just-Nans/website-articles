If you're streaming your game with [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), you might want to add an overlay to your stream.

The project https://github.com/Its-Just-Nans/obs-webview is a simple proof of concept to add the simplest overlay (a text) to your stream.

The cool thing is that you only need a browser, no need to have a server running.

The web page has two pages:

- the editor where you can change the text and move it - this page only update a [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) value
- the `/view` page that you can add as a browser source in OBS - this page only render the text located in the [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)

The idea next would be to improve the editor to use css animation for example.
