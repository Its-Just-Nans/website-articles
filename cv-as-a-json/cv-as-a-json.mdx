This following post is a follow-up of [this post](https://n4n5.dev/articles/cv-integration/).

My CV is now built from a JSON file and the [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) integration in `lualatex`

A little lua script reads the JSON and generates the CV with the data. The Layout is hardcoded in the script.

the script is now single-file and self invoking itself inside `lualatex`

<Thought>
how **fun** ?

It's now a `luarocks` package! Because why not?
