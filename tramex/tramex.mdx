Tiny proxy (https://github.com/Its-Just-Nans/proxy-ws) used during development because of some issues because of CORS (https://tramex.github.io/tramex/docs/knowledge_base.html#cors-errors)

[3GPP](https://www.3gpp.org/) creates the specification using docx (why?). In these files, [ASN.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASN.1) is used to describe the messages.

The project `docx-asn1` (https://github.com/Its-Just-Nans/docx-asn1) is used to extract ASN.1 from docx files.

The project `types_lte_3gpp` (https://github.com/tramex/types_lte_3gpp) is used to convert the ASN.1 files to Rust files types using `hampi` (https://github.com/ystero-dev/hampi generates the `hampi-rs-asn1c`).

Raw ASN.1 files are also available in the `asn/` directory: https://github.com/Its-Just-Nans/types_lte_3gpp/tree/main/asn

Unfortunately some protocols are not available as ASN.1. But some protocols are still described in the docx (but with multiple - complicated - tables)
