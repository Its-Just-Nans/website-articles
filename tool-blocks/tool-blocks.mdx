**tool-blocks** : the toolbox made of blocks

The idea behind tool-blocks is to provide two things:

- the primary block which is the base of the toolbox, it handles how blocks are installed, managed, displayed and updated
- a set of basic blocks that can act as tools and demo


The major part of the primary block is a back-end part. His front-end part is a simple sidebar indexing all the blocks and a menu to install, update and remove them.
The other part of the screen is the current block displayed.

Blocks are displayed inside an iframe to avoid any conflict with the main page but also to allow block-developers to use any technology they want.

Unfortunately, the project was aborted because of the lack of time and utility (nowadays most of tools are available as web-apps).
