Ticket #0001 - Redirection not handling HTTPS

## Bug

Some domains are https only - the browser only use https for these domains[^https-only]. Thus, redirections are not working with these domains

## What should happen

Redirections should work with all domains

## How to reproduce

- Have a httpS only domains like `.dev`
- Setup a "ovh redirection"
- OVH will create a `A DNS` entry linked to 213.186.33.5 (redirect.ovh.net) under the hood
- Try to use the redirection
    - Using curl[^curl]:

        ```sh
        curl http://subdomain.domain.dev # -> works because http
        curl https://subdomain.domain.dev # -> DONT works because https
        ```
    - Using browser:

        not working because the browser forces us to use HTTPS
