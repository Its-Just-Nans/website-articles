> **Continuous integration of my curriculum vitae**

My CV is in latex and I can compile it using a TeX engine like `lualatex`.

Using some GitHub Action, it is now automatically generated as pdf (from the latex files).

Each time I push a commit to the `main` branch, my CV is generated and uploaded as artifact.
