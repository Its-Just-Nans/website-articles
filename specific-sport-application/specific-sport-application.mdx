import { Image } from 'astro:assets';

A famous sport application which had me really disappointed.

- Has connection issues.

import Img from "./sport-application.jpg"

<Image src={Img} alt="Specific sport application bug" />

- Always push the user to pay for premium features in the app.

- Auto-stop by default when recording an activity ? Without auto-(re)start ?! Really ?!

- Doesn't know how to [use GPS properly](https://n4n5.dev/sportiva/activity/9222545148/).

It's enough for me.

Now launching [Sportiva](https://n4n5.dev/sportiva/) - export your Strava data and view it in a free way (ngl only essentials functions).
