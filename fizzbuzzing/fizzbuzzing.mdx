# FizzBuzzing

The [Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) program is a classic program used to test a programmer.

It's very simple, you have to print numbers, but:

-   if the number is a multiple of **3**, you print `Fizz`
-   if the number is a multiple of **5**, you print `Buzz`
-   if the number is a multiple of **3 and 5**, you print `FizzBuzz`

In this article, we will see the classic version and a second version using a different logic.

If you want to test the javascript code, you can click below to add a special directive which will disable the optimization of the function.

<Button client:load>
    <span slot="button">Use `%NeverOptimizeFunction` directive</span>
    <div slot="on">
        <span>Programmes showed here are using the directive `%NeverOptimizeFunction`.</span>
        <div>To run the code, you can use:</div>
        <Code lang="sh" code={"node --allow-natives-syntax index.js"} />
    </div>
    <div slot="off"></div>
</Button>

> Quick note here to say that in the code we will not use the string `Fizz`, `Buzz` and `FizzBuzz` but numbers.

## Classic FizzBuzz in Javascript

<SpecialCode client:load>
    <Code lang="js" code={useDirective(files["fizzbuzz_0.js"], true)} slot="on" />
    <Code lang="js" code={useDirective(files["fizzbuzz_0.js"], false)} slot="off" />
</SpecialCode>

## The twist: the algorithm is cycling!

If you look at the program and it's output, you can see that the algorithm is cycling with a modulo of 15.

Why? because number divisible by 15 are divisible by 3 and 5 which is the `FizzBuzz` case.

<details>

<summary>Here is a little proof by [The Z3 Theorem Prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)</summary>

<Code lang="python" code={files["z3_proof.py"]} />

</details>

Now let's use that information to "optimize" the program: we don't need to test every number! We can just cycle through the 15 cases.

## FizzBuzz in Javascript using array

<SpecialCode client:load>
    <Code lang="js" code={useDirective(files["fizzbuzz_1.js"], true)} slot="on" />
    <Code lang="js" code={useDirective(files["fizzbuzz_1.js"], false)} slot="off" />
</SpecialCode>

Array are great, but we have some useless `0` values in it ðŸ˜¯!

## FizzBuzz in Javascript using object

Here is an optimized version, using an object to remove useless `0` values.

<SpecialCode client:load>
    <Code lang="js" code={useDirective(files["fizzbuzz_2.js"], true)} slot="on" />
    <Code lang="js" code={useDirective(files["fizzbuzz_2.js"], false)} slot="off" />
</SpecialCode>

Isn't it _beautiful_? **The fizzbuzz is only `tab[n % 15] ?? n`!**

## FizzBuzzing in C++

First, here is the main program, it uses a external fizzbuzz function.

We can also see that we are using a preprocessor directive to disable the output of the function.

<Code lang="cpp" code={files["main.cpp"]} />

Second, for demonstration purpose we will use constants number to be replace words.

### Classic FizzBuzz in C++

Just to remind you here is the classic fizzbuzz in C++:

<Code lang="cpp" code={files["fizzbuzz_classic.cpp"]} />

### Array FizzBuzz in C++

<Code lang="cpp" code={files["fizzbuzz_array.cpp"]} />

## Benchmarking

Now let's benchmark the different versions of the C++ programs. These benchmark were made using [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine).

import benchmark1 from "./benchmark-O0.jpg";

<img alt="benchmark 1" src={benchmark1.src} />

In this benchmark, we can see that results are quite the same with [zig](https://ziglang.org/). However, we can see the difference between the classic version and the array version! We successfully optimized the program!

import benchmark_03 from "./benchmark-O3.jpg";

<img alt="benchmark -O3" src={benchmark_03.src} />

In this benchmark we can see that sadly, with optimization, results are quite the same! (I suppose [zig](https://ziglang.org/) this time decided to remove the whole program - quite an optimization).

import benchmark_03_Output from "./benchmark-O3-DOUTPUT.jpg";

<img alt="benchmark -O3 -DOUTPUT" src={benchmark_03_Output.src} />

Finally, this benchmark show that with a real world program with an output, both version are equivalent because of the slowdown of writing to the output.

## Conclusion

The focus of this article is on compiler optimizations. In the benchmark, we force the default optimization level of the compiler to `-O0`.
But using optimization such as `-O3`, code will be optimized thanks to compilers and results are equivalents!

<Code lang="makefile" code={files["Makefile"]} />

<summary>More</summary>

In our case, in a classic complete fizzbuzz function, we will do

```cpp
void fizzbuzz_full(int num_limit){
    for(int i = 0; i < num_limit;i++){
        fizzbuzz(i);
    }
}
```

But technically, to go even faster, we could (with our logic) simply iterate through our array without bothering with the modulo check!
