<Thought>

To get the same result as

```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs example.apk
```

you need to hash the certificate value of the scheme from the APK Signing Block.

Fortunately, the demo (https://n4n5.dev/apksig/) hashes every array, so you can effectively see the hashes of the certificate value.
