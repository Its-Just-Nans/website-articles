`student-app` is a quiz app developed by three students for students.

This project was created for the "Android" course at DUT R&T. The topic was open-ended, with only one requirement: use a database provided by the instructor.

The challenge was that the database could only store key-value pairs (related to a user id), so we had to figure out a way to save the questions and answers in a format that would allow easy retrieval.
