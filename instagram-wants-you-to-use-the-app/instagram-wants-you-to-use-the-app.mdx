> **Instagram wants you to use the app**

Instagram loads its "reels" using [`URL.createObjectURL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL_static) to play the video.

When you start scrolling, Instagram preloads five videos by creating five object URLs.

import { Image } from 'astro:assets';

import streams from "./instagram-stream.png"

<Image src={streams} alt="screenshot of the 5 object" />

Then you scroll more, and it starts to load more videos.

However, Instagram never calls [`URL.revokeObjectURL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/revokeObjectURL_static) to free the memory.

As a result, the memory usage of the tab increases, and at a certain point, the tab may crash.

I guess it's to ~~annoy~~ encourage you to use the app.

Moral of the story: ~~read the docs~~ stop scrolling.
