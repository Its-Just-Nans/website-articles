Wanted to create an interactive map of the Pokemon Platinum game.

Started the project using https://www.pokebip.com/ pictures

Problems:

- a better project exists: https://pkmnmap4.web.app/ using [bulbapedia pics](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Platinum_locations)
- pokebip images haven't homogeneous size
- no real pokebip license on the images (no infos on the website)

Anyway let just make the project:

- https://github.com/Its-Just-Nans/pokemon-platinum-map

import { Image } from "astro:assets"


<div style="text-align: center">
    <p>Cool [16MB map image](https://github.com/ICEREG1992/pkmnmap4/blob/main/maps/Overworld.png) by [William Sullivan](https://github.com/ICEREG1992)</p>
