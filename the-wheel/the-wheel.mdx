Seen a lot on stackoverflow (and elsewhere): "Don't reinvent the wheel".

import Thought from "@components/Thought.astro"

<Thought>
"Si on ne réinvente pas la roue, on ne peut pas l'améliorer"
</Thought>

If you reinvent a concept, you can understand it better.

How can you improve something if you don't understand how it works?
