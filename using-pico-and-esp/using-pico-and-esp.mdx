## Raspberry Pico: relp a program with [`rshell`](https://github.com/dhylands/rshell)

- Press the BOOTSEL button on the Pico while connecting the Pico to the computer with a USB cable
- The Pico will appear as an USB drive
- Download the micropython bootloader (`.utf2`): [https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO/](https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO/)
- Drag and drop the `.utf2` on the Pico USB drive
- The Pico will disconnect and reconnect as a new USB drive
- Install `rshell` with `python -m pip install rshell`
- Add the user to the `dialout` group with `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`
- start `rshell`, it will automatically connect to it
- To start a RELP enter `repl`, you will see three right arrows “>>>”

## Raspberry Pico: upload a program with `pyboard`

- Download `pyboard.py` from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micropython/micropython/master/tools/pyboard.py
- Create your program `boot.py`
- Run `python3 pyboard.py --device /dev/ttyUSB0 -f cp :boot.py boot.py`

## ESP32: upload a program with [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

- Install the ESP32 board in the Arduino IDE
- Select the board and the port
- Press button RESET (EN) on the ESP32 until `Connecting...` appears in the IDE
- The program will upload
