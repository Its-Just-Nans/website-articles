# arduino-cli

## Install the package `arduino-cli`

For example with `nix-env`

```sh
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.arduino-cli
```

## Add user to the `dialout` group

We will need access to the `/dev/ttyACM0` as a simple user.

An other unelegant solution is to run all the commands as root.

```sh
# add the current user to the group "dialout"
sudo usermod -a -G dialout
```

To ensure that your current shell is using the `dialout` group, you can use the command `id`.

If you don't have the `dialout` group you can force reloading your shell by using `su - $USER`

## List the boards

```sh
arduino-cli board list
```

This command should shows the correct tty (for example `/dev/ttyACM0`) and the "Fully Qualified Board Name" also known as `fqbn`

## Install a library

If you need a library, you can install it with

```sh
arduino-cli lib install LIBRARY_NAME
```

## Compile the sketch

We will need to precise the `fqbn`

```sh
arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:avr:uno sketch.ino
```

## Upload the sketch

```sh
arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyACM0 --fqbn arduino:avr:uno sketch.ino
```

## Interact with the arduino

When using the [default arduino software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), we have an integrated serial monitor. But here, we are using the CLI and de facto there are no GUI so we will use the useful `screen` [command](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html)!

To do so, we need:

-   the tty (for example `/dev/ttyACM0`)
-   the baud rate (the baud rate is specified in the sketch using `Serial.begin(115200);`)

```sh
screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
```

To leave the screen session we can use `Ctrl+a` then `k` (for `kill`), the screen should then ask a confirmation with `y` key

## Other useful commands

```sh
arduino-cli config init # create a config file

arduino-cli core update-index  # update the index

arduino-cli core install arduino:avr ## install arduino AVR family board

arduino-cli board listall # list supported board

arduino-cli board details -b arduino:avr:nano # show detail on this board (to find the correct option)
```

## Command line completion

```sh
arduino-cli completion bash > arduino-cli.sh
mv arduino-cli.sh /etc/bash_completion.d/ # need root
```
