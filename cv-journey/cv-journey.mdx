## The beginning

The journey start in High School, where I needed to create a CV for my first job application. I wasn't really into computers back then, so I just used the classic [LibreOffice Writer](https://www.libreoffice.org/) to create a simple CV. It was a tedious process, and I had to manually format everything. Painfull, but managable since there was not so much into it.

LibreOffice Writer is all fun until you want something serious.

## <DateTitle date="2022/01"> $\LaTeX$ superiority</DateTitle>

Then in Engineering School, I needed again a CV for an internship. This time, I decided to use $\LaTeX$, which was a bit more complex but allowed for better formatting and structure. $\LaTeX$ allows comes with [the simplicity of a single text file](https://stephango.com/file-over-app).

In the end, my CV was a single `.tex` file in a GIT repository hosted on [Github](https://github.com/).

Wait...you said on Github? What not building it with GitHub Actions?

So I did. I created a simple workflow that would compile my `.tex` file into a PDF every time I pushed changes to the repository. This was great until I encountered my next ~problem~ challenge.

Here is a little summary of the superiority of $\LaTeX$:

Pros of $\LaTeX$:
- better formatting and structure
- very powerful for complex documents
- very good for mathematical equations
- a cool command to show the logo `\LaTeX`: $\LaTeX$

Cons of $\LaTeX$:
- Big download size
    ```
    $ apt install texlive-full
    Installing:
    texlive-full
    ...
    Summary:
    Upgrading: 0, Installing: 797, Removing: 0, Not Upgrading: 0
    Download size: 4820 MB
    Space needed: 9183 MB
    ```
- Could be complex for beginners (pixel perfect layout is tricky)
- Slow


## <DateTitle date="2024/02">Lua machinery</DateTitle>

Then I faced a new ~problem~ challenge: I wanted to have two CVs, one in English and one in French, and with the same layout. I decided to change paradigm and use two files: one for the content and one for the layout.

The content file was in JSON format, and the layout file was in $\LaTeX$.

<Helper summary="What JSON is doing here?">
Yes **JSON**, because I believe in the [file over app](https://stephango.com/file-over-app) philosophy. And at night, I dream of a json per contact like the [RFC9553](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9553).

Wait... you like RFC9553? You should definitely check out https://crates.io/crates/jscontact


(yes indeed this advertisement was unwanted but/and free)
</Helper>

This is where I used the real power of `lualatex`, and used the [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) integration to load JSON into the document. I could now generate both CVs from the same content file, just by changing one parameter, the `lang`.

## <DateTitle date="2024/02">Lua sorcery</DateTitle>

This was a great improvement, but I didn't really liked to have too much mix of Lua and $\LaTeX$ in the same file (circa 2024-11). So I created a separate file Lua file to handle the JSON loading and parsing, and used it in my $\LaTeX$ file. But I still wasn't satisfied with the result. I had three files: one for the content, one for the layout, and one for the Lua code. This is where I decided to change [again](https://github.com/Its-Just-Nans/curriculum-vitae/commit/93fa0836159265aa59c687693cbb29d182babe1d). So the attentive reader will think about a luafile that create a `.tex` file from the JSON content, and then compile it with `lualatex`. But this is too easy, too simple and as an idiot, I wanted something more complex.

```
"An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity"
- Terry A. Davis (RIP child of God)
```

So naturally, I created a Lua file that generates a `.tex` that contains calls to the Lua code, then calls `lualatex` to compile it. Yes, a self-invoking Lua script that generates a `.tex` file and compiles it. (you're allowed the read the sentence again to see the ~complexity~ stupidity of this nonsense)


In the end, this method was quite fast and was able to generate both CVs with a single command. But the edition and re-rendering was still quite slow, as I had to wait for `lualatex` to compile the document every time I made a change.

I ended up pushing this fraudulent script into [luarocks](https://luarocks.org/modules/its-just-nans/curriculum_vitae) just incase someone wants to use it :nerd_face:. The lua file is a lib and a script at the same time.

The repository is available here: https://github.com/Its-Just-Nans/curriculum-vitae

Here is the timing for creating two CVs with this method:

```
$ time lua curriculum_vitae.lua
real    0m3,297s
user    0m2,907s
sys     0m0,389s
```

## <DateTitle date="2025/06">Typst supremacy</DateTitle>

Then after playing around with [Typst](https://typst.app/), you cannot resist the temptation to rewrite everything. Typst is a modern document preparation system that is much faster than $\LaTeX$ and has a simpler syntax.

It also has built-in support for JSON (and so much more), which means I can load my content file directly into the document. And Typst supports programming inside the document, so I can do my layout from the JSON.

Also Typst use incremental compilation, which means that it only recompiles the parts of the document that have changed, making it much faster than $\LaTeX$ when editing it.
